 2. [Download the python client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/krpc) and install it using:

    ```python setup.py install```

    Or, alternatively, install it using pip:

    ```pip install krpc```

 3. See [python/example.py](python/example.py) for an example script that sends commands to control the active vessel using kRPC.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/djungelorm/krpc/wiki) for more information.
